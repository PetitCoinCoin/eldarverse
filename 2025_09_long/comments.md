Using pow in problem D allowed me to reduce runtime from 2min down to 1min. But applying the modulo before the gauss sum allowed me to go down to less than 30sec (and then removing the use of pow seemed a liiiittle bit more efficient).

Problem E could probably be more clever and more elegant. Maybe I'll take some time to rework this (well, we no that I won't, but maybe).
