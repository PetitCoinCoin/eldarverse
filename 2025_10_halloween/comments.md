I finally managed to do a part C with 3C !! I solved it more or less manually for some test cases. And retro-engineered it to find a heuristic and have a solution that runs in less than a sec.

Day 5 is the first time I managed to solve all 3 parts in a reasonable time, and programmatically. Yeay \o/

Always pleasant to see some artwork. Nice ones in day 6!
